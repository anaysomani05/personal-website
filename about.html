            <p>Hi, I am Anay! I grew up in Central and South India, and sports have always been a huge part of my life. I spent most of my time playing cricket, tennis, and football, which taught me a lot about resilience and patience. When I'm not busy with school or work, I still love watching sports and traveling to new places.</p>

            <p>Currently, I'm a student at the University of Arizona, working on dual degrees in Statistics and Computer Science. I enjoy applying what I learn in my classes to real-world situations. I've had the chance to work as a Software Engineer Intern at <a href="https://www.deloitte.com/in/en.html" target="_blank">Deloitte</a> building full stack AI applications, and I've also worked at <a href="https://techlaunch.arizona.edu/" target="_blank">Tech Launch Arizona</a> in Student Ventures and Program Development.</p>

            <p>I am interested in technology, markets, fintech, and healthcare.</p>
