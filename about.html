            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Anay Somani, a junior at the University of Arizona double majoring in Computer Science and Statistics. I enjoy understanding how things work and building them. I'm curious about using data and models to predict something, explore uncertainty, test strategies, and make better decisions. I also enjoy learning on my own and experimenting with new ideas. </p>
            
            <p>Sports have been a big part of my life. They've taught me resilience, teamwork, and how to stay calm and perfrom under pressure.</p>
            
            <p>I'm interested in technology, markets, fintech, and healthcare.</p>

            <h2>Things I believe in</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Play the long game. Work hard. Let time, effort, and luck do their work.</li>
                <li>Continuously seek discomfort. Be curious.</li>
                <li>Nobody has it all figured out.</li>
                <li>Trust the process. The dots always connect later.</li>
